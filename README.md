## 🌟 Overview

This project aims to predict the stock prices of a company using historical data. It employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies and complex patterns in time-series data.

### 🔑 Key Features

- Historical Data Analysis: Processes historical stock price data to identify patterns and trends.
- LSTM Neural Networks: Efficiently captures long-term dependencies for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- Interactive Visualization: Visualizes historical and predicted stock price trends using comprehensive graphs.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- Pyngrok
